      <p>
        We want to democratize the ability to sell stuff online. You're a creative person; you create a lot of content. But most of it, you never sell! It's either too hard, or too time-consuming, or it doesn't even make sense to put in a store!
      </p>
      <p>
        We let you easily sell the stuff you weren't able to before. It turns out, that includes a lot of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're early in the process of changing the world and all that fun stuff, but we're <a href="mailto:hi@gumroad.com">always looking for help</a>.
